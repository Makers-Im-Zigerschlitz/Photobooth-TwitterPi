# Photobooth-TwitterPi
Interactive Photobooth with auto-upload to Twitter

Introduction
=============
TwitterPi is a photobooth-software written in Python. it is easy to use and needs only a few settings.
The scripts are written using RaspberryPi-Libraries. So it is possible to use it with a normal webcam, but you have to change a lot.
I recommend to use Raspbian Jessie (**not Lite!**)

Getting started
---------------
To start, you need a few dependencies. With Raspbian Jessie you have the most already installed but there are still some missing.
One of the most important ones is PyQt5. You can install it easily with `sudo apt install python-pyqt5`
