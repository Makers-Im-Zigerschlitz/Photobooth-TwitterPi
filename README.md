# Photobooth-TwitterPi
Interactive Photobooth with auto-upload to Twitter

#Introduction
TwitterPi is a photobooth-software written in Python. it is easy to use and needs only a few settings.
The scripts are written using RaspberryPi-Libraries. So it is possible to use it with a normal webcam, but you have to change a lot.
I recommend to use Raspbian Jessie (**not Lite**)
